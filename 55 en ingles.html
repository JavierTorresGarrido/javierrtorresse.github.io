<h2>
<br>In a broad sense, the origins of globalization
<br>date back to the Age of Discovery, among the
<br>15th and 17th centuries, when Europeans explored the Americas
<br>and other regions of the world. More precisely,
<br>It is often pointed out that globalization began at the end of the
<br>World War II in 1945 and intensified
<br>with the end of the Cold War at the end of the 20th century.
<br>The process is still ongoing, especially in the context of development
<br>computer networks (Internet) and new technologies
<br>telecommunications, which have brought populations into contact with
<br>and geographically distant markets.
