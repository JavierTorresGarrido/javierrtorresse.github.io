<h3> <font color="#00FFFB"> Chilesaurus diegosuarezi is the only known species of the extinct genus <br>
 Dinosaur Chilesaurus that lived during the Late Jurassic, 150-146 years ago<br>
  million years in what is now South America. Their fossils were discovered
   in the Aysén region, in Chile.2 At the time of its description,<br>
    it was considered one of the few herbivorous theropods known to the outside<br>
     of the coelurosaurs.1 It has an unusual combination of features of <br>
 theropods, ornithischians, and sauropodomorphs, so this genus has important <br>
implications for understanding dinosaur evolution, such as<br>
 as the traditional division between saurischians and ornithischians or as support for the<br>
  alternative proposal of the Ornithoscelida group.3​ According to the fossils<br>
   found in the Toqui Formation, Chilesaurus coexisted with another theropod<br>
    small-sized, basal crocodyliform, and sauropod dinosaurs both<br>
     diplodocids as titanosaurs.	</font>	<br>

<h3> <font color="#00FFFB"> Chilesaurus measured about 3.2 meters from nose to tail. The little <br>
 head has small, spatula-shaped teeth pointing obliquely forwards. This<br>
  dentition, unique to theropods, is typical of a herbivore, indicating that Chilesaurus was <br>
  it fed on plants, a very unusual adaptation in theropods, since most were carnivorous.<br>

<br>
<br>
Another adaptation for eating plants is that the pubic bone in the pelvis points backwards. Such<br>
 arrangement of the pelvis is typical of ornithischians, which is why it was initially believed that<br>
  part of the Chilesaurus fossils belonged to this clade. The later members of<br>
   Chilesaurus had become less adapted to running, as shown by a small crest<br>
    cnemial on the upper front part of the tibia, and a broad foot, with a first toe of<br>
     weight support. Chilesaurus could defend itself with a robust arm, equipped with two <br>
     claws, first large and widely extended, like basal sauropodomorphs.<br> </font> </h3>
